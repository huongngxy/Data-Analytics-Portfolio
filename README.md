# Data Analytics Portfolio 

:sunflower: Hi, I am Huong - a Business Admistration student passionate about data analytics. <br>
This repository is a collection of projects that I have undertaken for self-learning, aimed at improving my analytical skills. <br>
Analyzed were the following dataset: <br> 
**1. Adidas Sales:** This dataset covers the sales performance of Adidas products across the United States from 2020 to 2021. The analysis provides valueable insights into sales patterns among different retailers, product-specific trends, and regional performance.
- Language: Python in Jupyter Notebook 
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heemalichaudhari/adidas-sales-dataset/)
- Note: I used Plotly to create interactive charts which cannot be displayed on Github since the platform does not support this feature. To adress this, I have rendered my notebook using Nbviewer. Please click [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/huongngxy/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Adidas%20Sales/Adidas%20Sales%20Analysis.ipynb) to view the complete version of my notebook with all interative elements. <br>
**2. Billionaires Statistics:** This dataset provides detailed information about the worldâ€™s billionaires in 2023. The analysis focuses on demographic patterns, wealth distribution, industry concentration, and business sectors among the billionaires. Please click [here](https://huongngxy.github.io/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/Billionaires%20Statistics/Data_Analysis.html#) to see the final results.
