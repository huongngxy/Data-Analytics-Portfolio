# Data Analytics Portfolio 

:seedling: Hi, I am Huong - a Business Admistration student passionate about Data Analytics. <br>
This repository is a collection of projects that I have undertaken for self-learning and improving my analytical skills. 
## Projects

### 1. Adidas Sales in the U.S. <br>
- **Description**: The dataset covers the sales performance of Adidas products across the United States from 2020 to 2021. Included are data about retailers, geographical information, product types, sales methods, and other sales metrics such as units sold, operating profit, and margin. The analysis provides insights into sales patterns among different retailers, product-specific trends, and regional performance.
> [!NOTE]
> I used Plotly to create interactive charts in Jupyter Notebook. However, these charts cannot be displayed on Github since the platform does not support this feature. As a solution, I have rendered my notebook using Nbviewer. Please click **[here](https://nbviewer.org/github/huongngxy/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Adidas%20Sales/Adidas%20Sales%20Analysis.ipynb)** to view the complete version of my notebook with all interactive elements. 
- **Language:** Python in Jupyter Notebook 
- **Data source:** Kaggle
